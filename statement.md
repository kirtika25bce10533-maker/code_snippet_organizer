Code Snippet Organiser – Project Statement

1. Introduction

In modern software development, programmers often reuse small portions of code to solve common problems. However, these useful snippets are usually scattered across different files, notes, or online sources. Managing them becomes difficult and time-consuming. The Code Snippet Organiser is a simple tool designed to store, organise, and retrieve code snippets efficiently so developers can work faster and more productively.

2. Problem Statement

Developers frequently waste time searching for code they have written or used previously. Without a central place to store snippets, code becomes lost, duplicated, or unorganised. This results in reduced efficiency and unnecessary repetition of work. There is a need for an easy-to-use system that keeps snippets well-structured, easily searchable, and accessible whenever required.

3. Goals / Objectives

To create a centralised platform for storing reusable code snippets.

To help users quickly search, filter, and access their saved snippets.

To allow categorisation of snippets based on programming language, topic, or tags.

To increase coding efficiency by reducing repetitive writing of the same code.

To provide a clean and user-friendly interface for organising snippets.


4. Features

Add Snippets: Users can store code snippets with a title, category, and short description.

Edit & Delete: Existing snippets can be updated or removed easily.

Search Functionality: Quickly find snippets by keyword, language, or tag.

Categorisation: Snippets can be grouped into custom categories or programming languages.

Copy to Clipboard: One-click copy feature for using snippets instantly.

Simple Interface: Clean and minimal layout for smooth user experience.

Data Storage: Snippets stored in local files/database for future use (depending on implementation).
